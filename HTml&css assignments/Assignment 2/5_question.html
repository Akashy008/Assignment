            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create web pages and define their structure and content. It is the backbone of most web content and is interpreted by web browsers to render web pages as we see them.This HTML code creates a basic web page with a title, heading, paragraph, unordered list, and a hyperlink. When rendered in a web browser, it would display as a structured web page with content. HTML can be further enhanced and styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and made interactive with JavaScript

                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents. It is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual appearance of web pages. CSS separates the structure and content of a web page (defined by HTML) from its visual design, allowing web developers to style web pages consistently and efficiently.
