                HTML documents typically used the &lt!DOCTYPE&gt HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"> declaration.
            </td>
            <td>
                HTML5 introduced a simplified &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt declaration that is easier to remember and use.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Older versions of HTML had stricter parsing rules, meaning that errors in the HTML structure could lead to rendering issues or unexpected behavior.
            </td>
            <td>HTML5 has more lenient parsing rules, which means that browsers are more forgiving of minor syntax errors. This helps improve backward compatibility and simplifies development

        <tr>
            <td> In older HTML versions, adding multimedia content like audio and video required third-party plugins like Adobe Flash.
            </td>
            <td>
                HTML5 includes native support for audio and video elements (&ltaudio&gt and &ltvideo&gt), making it easier to embed multimedia content directly into web pages without relying on plugins.

            <td>Older HTML versions had limited support for client-side storage.
            </td>

                HTML5 introduced the Geolocation API, which allows web applications to access a user's location, enabling location-based services and applications.
