Diffrence between Relative and absolute positioning-
ans-
 Absolute and relative positioning are two different Css positioning techniques used to control the placement of elements on a web page. They are primarily used in web development to specify how elements are positioned within their containing elements or the overall page layout. Here's a breakdown of the key differences between absolute and relative positioning:

Reference Point:

Relative Positioning: Elements with relative positioning are positioned relative to their default or normal position in the document flow. They still occupy space in the layout, and other elements in the flow may be affected by their presence.

Absolute Positioning: Elements with absolute positioning are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor, which means they are taken out of the normal document flow. If no ancestor has a positioning property set, they are positioned relative to the initial containing block


Document Flow:
Relative Positioning: Elements with relative positioning affect the normal document flow. Other elements in the document flow may be positioned relative to or affected by the element with relative positioning.

Absolute Positioning: Elements with absolute positioning do not affect the normal document flow. Other elements are positioned as if the absolutely positioned element does not exist.

Space Occupied:
Relative Positioning: Elements with relative positioning occupy space in the layout as per their default or normal position in the document flow. This means they can push other elements around.

Absolute Positioning: Elements with absolute positioning do not occupy space in the layout, so they do not affect the placement of other elements. This can lead to overlapping if not managed properly.

Z-Index:
Relative Positioning: Elements with relative positioning can be stacked on top of each other using the z-index property, but their stacking order is determined by their position in the document flow.

Absolute Positioning: Elements with absolute positioning can also be stacked using the z-index property, and their stacking order is relative to their positioned ancestors.
