2- Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide  an example of how to use comments in an HTML document?

Answer- Comments in HTML are used to provide human-readable explanations or notes within the HTML code.  We can use ctrl+/ to mark comments. HTML comments do not display on the web page
 Example- 
 
<body>
    <!-- this is HTML definition -->
    <h1>HTML defines the content and structure of
your website</h1>
    
</body>
</html>

In this code( <!-- this is HTML definition --> ) is used to provide human-readable explanations to whoever checks or reads this code.
